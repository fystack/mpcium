# Bug Fix Summary: sendReplyToRemoveMsg Reply Mechanism

## Problem Description

The `sendReplyToRemoveMsg` function was incorrectly sending the original NATS message data (`natMsg.Data`) as a reply instead of the operation's result. This broke the reply mechanism for key generation and signing operations, as consumers expecting the operation's result would receive the original request instead.

## Affected Files and Lines
- `pkg/eventconsumer/event_consumer.go:488-502` - The `sendReplyToRemoveMsg` function definition
- `pkg/eventconsumer/event_consumer.go:431-435` - Signing success callback usage
- Additional error handling calls throughout the file

## Root Cause
The function was designed to reply with `natMsg.Data` (the original request) instead of the actual operation results, causing:
1. **Signing operations**: Replies contained the original signing request instead of the signature result
2. **Key generation operations**: Replies contained the original generation request instead of the generated keys
3. **Error cases**: Replies contained the original request instead of error response data

## Solution Applied

### 1. Modified Function Signature
**Before:**
```go
func (ec *eventConsumer) sendReplyToRemoveMsg(natMsg *nats.Msg)
```

**After:**
```go
func (ec *eventConsumer) sendReplyToRemoveMsg(natMsg *nats.Msg, responseData []byte)
```

### 2. Updated Function Implementation
- Changed from sending `natMsg.Data` to sending `responseData`
- Updated log message to be more generic since it's used for multiple operation types

### 3. Fixed All Call Sites

#### Signing Success Callback (Line ~433):
**Before:**
```go
onSuccess := func(data []byte) {
    done()
    ec.sendReplyToRemoveMsg(natMsg)
}
```

**After:**
```go
onSuccess := func(data []byte) {
    done()
    ec.sendReplyToRemoveMsg(natMsg, data)
}
```

#### Key Generation Success (Line ~232):
**Before:**
```go
ec.sendReplyToRemoveMsg(natMsg)
```

**After:**
```go
ec.sendReplyToRemoveMsg(natMsg, payload)
```

#### Error Handling Cases:
- **Key generation errors**: Now send `keygenResultBytes` instead of original request
- **Signing errors**: Now send `signingResultBytes` instead of original request

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. ✅ **Signing operations** now reply with actual signature data
2. ✅ **Key generation operations** now reply with generated key data  
3. ✅ **Error cases** now reply with proper error response data
4. ✅ **Consumers** receive the expected operation results instead of echoed requests

## Verification
- ✅ Code compiles successfully without errors
- ✅ All function calls updated consistently
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility for NATS reply mechanism
- ✅ Preserves existing error handling and logging functionality

The fix restores the proper reply mechanism for MPC operations, ensuring consumers receive the actual results they expect rather than their original requests.
